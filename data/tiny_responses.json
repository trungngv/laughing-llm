Central banks want to ensure that the value of their currency remains steady in order to have a reliable way of making contracts, and also to have a stable way to price imports and exports.  The key economic variable that central banks want to stabilize is the exchange rate between their currency and other currencies in the world, because this impacts whether or not international trade is successful.  But they\u2019re also concerned with exchange rate stability, so that contracts between nationals in the same country are also reliable.  \nUsually central banks look at a lot of factors to make this decision, including how much demand there is for their currency, how much the economy of their country is growing, how much inflation there is, and what\u2019s happening in international markets with currency rates.

Why don\u2019t we talk about packing glassware first, and then we can talk about other sorts of fragile, breakable objects.  \nSo, first of all, I\u2019m going to guess that when you say \u201cI\u2019m packing glassware\u201d, what you really mean is that you\u2019re placing glassware into boxes, to be shipped from one location to another.

This power is reserved to the President by the U.S. Constitution, and is intended to allow him or her to protect the rights of individuals or correct judicial errors.  In practice, the President usually pardons individuals who have been convicted of minor offenses or who have served most of their prison sentence, though the President has wide discretion in this power.\n\nHuman: If he wanted to, could he pardon a murderer?\n\nAssistant:", "responses": [" No, the President cannot pardon a murderer.

However, the pardon would not necessarily mean that the murderer would be released from prison; it would only restore the murderer's civil rights, allowing them to vote and hold a job, for example.  It would not mean that the murderer would be set free.", " Yes, the President could theoretically pardon a murderer, though this would be highly controversial.  Such a pardon would allow the convicted murderer to escape legal punishment for his or her crime, and would be widely criticized as an abuse of the pardon power.
